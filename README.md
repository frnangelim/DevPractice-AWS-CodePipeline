# DevPractice - AWS CodePipeline

In this project I started a react application with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) then deployed in [AWS] (https://aws.amazon.com/) using a [CodePipeline] (https://aws.amazon.com/pt/codepipeline/).

Results available [here] (https://xqn-cicd-test.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
